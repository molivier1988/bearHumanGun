# bearHumanGun

A mini project to practice creating and calling functions.

## Description

The project is based around the game bearHumanGun (similar to rockPaperScissors).

This app demonstrates the use of functions to encapsulate repetitive code into separate and discrete blocks which can then be called as required.

## Getting Started

Simply call the playGame() function.

```javascript
playGame();
```

### Dependencies

App needs to run in browser of your choice. Running in VS Code using `node bearHumanGun.js` will return an error because of the use of the `prompt()` method
